            <h2>Our Libatious Philosophy</h2>
                <p class="drop-cap">Wine is the liquid libation which makes us smile at the world and the world smile back. It helps us to see our friends friendlier, and to see our homes homier. Love of home, (oikophilia) is greatly encouraged by a healthy and balanced drinking life.<br><br> Although thanks to strong drink overactive imaginations provide everything that gossip demands, strong drink also strengthens the bonds of family, home and society. How many homes now exist because of a man’s judicious use of ‘liquid courage?’ How many homes are the brighter for the golden gloss a few glasses will give, or how many friendships have been more quickly restored over a few shots?<br><br>
                  The home is the bedrock of civilization, and love of home is the animus which keeps it alive. Therefore, we can only draw the wonderful conclusion that wine and good drink are an instrumental tool for home-building, the ornament upon our doors. As good cheer rises to the gables, we can toast to the home-building and love-inducing nature that good drink compels.
