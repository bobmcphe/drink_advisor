## What is the vision of this product? 
Drink Advisor is a tool used to track individual preferences related to beer and wine. It takes in various user parameters and returns the data in an easy to read and informative format for users to better determine what their favorite beer or wine is.

## What pain point does this project solve? 

Remembering what we know, like and think about various beverages can be challenging. Drink Advisor allows the end-user to learn more about libations and themselves by keeping track of various drinks, the qualities of the drinks (e.g. the tannin levels which when low can make a wine ‘flabby’ or when too high ‘ascetic’), to encourage a more articulate and knowledgeable wine and beer connoisseur. This data is then transferred into graphs for the convenience of the user. 

## Why should we care about your product?
Drink Advisor simplifies the management of data and speeds the learning process for the drink enthusiast; a great need for our time-crunched lifestyles.
